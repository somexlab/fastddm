Installing in Google Colab
==========================

**FastDDM** can be installed in `Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/>`_, also with GPU
support. This allows to test the library without the need to install it locally on workstations.

.. tip::

    To better understand what the different options imply, see :ref:`build` and
    :ref:`install_sdist`.

Open a new notebook.
If you wish to use the GPU provided by the host server, change the ``runtime type``.
To do so, select from the toolbar ``Runtime > Change runtime type`` and select a GPU available from
the ``Hardware accelerator`` list.
As of today (3 April 2024), with the free plan, you should have access to the T4 GPU.
Save and go back to your notebook.

To check that the GPU is working, run the following command in a cell

.. code-block:: bash

    !nvidia-smi

From pip source distribution
----------------------------

To install the source distribution via ``pip``, run the command below

.. code-block:: bash

    !pip3 install --no-binary fastddm fastddm

From GitHub repository source code
----------------------------------

This is the preferred mode if you want to run the unit tests.
Clone the source code from the GitHub repository

.. code-block:: bash

    !git clone --depth 1 --branch <version_name> https://github.com/somexlab/fastddm.git

For example, to clone the version ``v0.3.8``, run

.. code-block:: bash

    !git clone --depth 1 --branch v0.3.8 https://github.com/somexlab/fastddm.git

Change directory to the source code one

.. code-block:: bash

    %cd fastddm

Finally, install **FastDDM**

.. code-block:: bash

    !python3 -m pip install .

.. note::

    To enable the installation options, refer to the :ref:`build` documentation.
    For example, to enable the CUDA core, run::

        !python3 -m pip install . --config-settings=cmake.define.ENABLE_CUDA=ON

.. warning::

    Due to the amount of available RAM memory, we also warmly recommend to enable the single
    precision math option.

.. tip::

    To run unit tests, you need some additional libraries. Run::

      !python3 -m pip install pytest pytest-regtest

    Then, run the tests with::

      !pytest -v

Now you can go back to your home directory and work with **FastDDM**!

.. code-block:: bash

    %cd ..
